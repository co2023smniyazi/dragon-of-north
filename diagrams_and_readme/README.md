> Looking for the full deep-dive explanation of architecture, controllers, security decisions, and feature rationale?
> Read: [FINAL_README.md](./FINAL_README.md)

This directory contains comprehensive diagrams and documentation for the Dragon of North authentication system. Each
diagram illustrates specific security features, workflows, and the technical solutions implemented to address real-world
security challenges.

## Purpose

These diagrams serve multiple purposes:

- **Technical Documentation**: Visual representation of complex authentication flows
- **Security Analysis**: Understanding threat models and mitigation strategies
- **Developer Onboarding**: Quick comprehension of system architecture
- **Audit Trail**: Documentation of security controls for compliance

## Diagram Structure

Each diagram file contains:

- **Mermaid diagram code** for visualization
- **Problem statement** explaining the failure mode being addressed
- **Technical solution** describing the implemented approach
- **Flow details** step-by-step process explanation
- **Implementation examples** with code samples and configuration
- **Benefits and risk mitigation**

## Security Features Covered

### Token Management & Security

- [Cookie-Based Token Management](./cookie-token-management.md) - Secure token storage with HttpOnly cookies
- [Multi-Device Session Management](./multi-device-session-management.md) - Device-aware session tracking and control

### System Overview

- [Security Features Overview](./security-features-overview.md) - Complete security architecture documentation

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 🔒 **Security-First Approach**

- **Cookie-based tokens** instead of localStorage for XSS protection
- **HttpOnly cookies** with SameSite policy for CSRF protection
- **Device fingerprinting** for multi-device session management
- **Real-time anomaly detection** for geographic and behavioral patterns

### 📊 **Comprehensive Monitoring**

- **Prometheus metrics** for application and business KPIs
- **Structured JSON logging** with centralized aggregation
- **Real-time alerting** for security events and performance issues
- **Distributed tracing** for request correlation

### 🏗️ **Scalable Architecture**

- **Modular design** with independent services
- **Reverse proxy** for edge security and load balancing
- **Database migration** with automated cleanup tasks
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment

### 🧪 **Quality Assurance**

- **Multi-layer testing** (unit, integration, E2E, load testing)
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Performance testing** with realistic user scenarios
- **Code quality gates** with SonarQube analysis

## Viewing Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax and can be viewed in:

- **GitHub/GitLab** (native rendering)
- **VS Code** (with Mermaid extension)
- **Online Mermaid editors** (mermaid.live)
- **Documentation tools** supporting Mermaid

## Security Philosophy

Each feature is designed with the principle of **defense in depth**:

1. **Identify** specific failure modes
2. **Implement** targeted mitigations
3. **Verify** through testing and monitoring
4. **Document** for transparency and audit

## Implementation Highlights

### 🛡️ **Advanced Security Features**

- **Cookie-based token management** prevents XSS attacks
- **Multi-device session tracking** with device fingerprinting
- **Real-time anomaly detection** for suspicious activities
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for compliance

### 📈 **Production-Ready Infrastructure**

- **Prometheus monitoring** with custom business metrics
- **Structured logging** with ELK stack integration
- **Automated CI/CD** with security scanning
- **Load testing** with K6 and performance validation

### 🔧 **Developer-Friendly Architecture**

- **Modular design** for independent development
- **Comprehensive testing** framework
- **Clear documentation** and examples
- **Automated quality gates**
